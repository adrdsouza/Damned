# NMI Payment Gateway Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the NMI (Network Merchants Inc) payment gateway integration with Medusa e-commerce platform for damneddesigns.com. The integration enables secure credit card processing through NMI's payment services.

## Configuration Details

### API Credentials
- **Integration Type**: Direct API Integration
- **Security Key**: `h3WD8p6Hc8WM4eEAqpb6fsTJMYp45Mrp`
- **Checkout Public Key**: `checkout_public_2he6c5yTBC73u3AV2reJeHb37TpEegUa`
- **API Endpoint**: `https://secure.nmi.com/api/transact.php`

### Environment
- **Environment**: Production
- **Plugin Location**: `/root/damneddesigns/packages/medusa-payment-nmi`
- **Plugin ID in Database**: `pp_nmi_nmi`

## Features

### Currently Implemented
- ✅ Basic payment processing (authorization & capture)
- ✅ Payment status tracking
- ✅ Integration with Medusa checkout flow
- ✅ Admin panel visibility
- ✅ Single region association

### Partially Implemented
- ⚠️ Refunding (API calls defined but need testing)
- ⚠️ Webhook handling (routes set up but need verification)
- ⚠️ Voiding transactions (methods defined but need verification)

### Not Implemented
- ❌ Customer payment method storage
- ❌ Subscription billing
- ❌ Advanced fraud detection

## Technical Implementation

### Plugin Structure
```
medusa-payment-nmi/
  ├── dist/               # Compiled JavaScript files
  ├── src/
  │   ├── api/
  │   │   └── routes/
  │   │       └── hooks/  # Webhook handling
  │   │           └── index.js
  │   ├── services/
  │   │   └── nmi-provider.js  # Main payment service logic
  │   └── index.js        # Plugin registration
  ├── .babelrc
  ├── package.json
  └── README.md
```

### Key Methods
- `initiatePayment`: Handles initial payment authorization
- `capturePayment`: Captures previously authorized payments
- `refundPayment`: Processes refunds (needs testing)
- `cancelPayment`: Voids transactions (needs testing)
- `getPaymentStatus`: Retrieves current payment status

### Database Integration
The plugin is registered in the database with:
- Payment provider entry: `pp_nmi_nmi`
- Region association: Connected to USA region (`reg_01JRHVWY8KXADW4FW7QHXATGFD`)

## Webhook Support
Webhook routes are defined in `/src/api/routes/hooks/index.js` and handle the following events:
- Transaction settlement notifications
- Refund processing notifications

**Implementation Status**: Basic webhook structure is set up but requires complete testing and potentially updating with NMI-specific signature verification.

## Maintenance Notes

### Adding to New Regions
To add the NMI payment provider to a new region, run:
```sql
INSERT INTO region_payment_provider (region_id, payment_provider_id, id) 
VALUES ('[new_region_id]', 'pp_nmi_nmi', '[new_unique_id]');
```

### Debugging
If payment issues occur, check the following:
1. Verify region associations in database
2. Check NMI API responses in server logs
3. Verify webhook payloads and processing

### Security Considerations
- All credentials are stored in `.env` files
- API calls use HTTPS
- No customer payment data is stored in the Medusa database

## Testing and Verification
To test the payment integration:
1. Create a test order in the storefront
2. Process a payment through the checkout flow
3. Verify the transaction in the NMI merchant portal

## Known Limitations
1. The implementation primarily handles one-time payments
2. Advanced NMI features are not fully integrated
3. Webhook handling needs verification with real NMI webhooks

## Future Enhancements
1. Complete refund handling testing
2. Improve webhook security with signature verification
3. Implement customer payment method storage (if needed)
4. Add detailed error handling and reporting
